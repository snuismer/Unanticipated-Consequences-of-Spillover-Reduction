# Unanticipated-Consequences-of-Spillover-Reduction
This repository contains three files used in the development of the manuscript "Unanticipated and undesirable consequences of spillover reduction for human health": 1) A data file that includes seroprevalence estimates "Prepped_Human_Seroprevalence_Data.csv", 2) a C++ source code file that executes stochastic simulations "Unanticipated_Consequences.cpp", and a Mathematica notebook that derives key analytical results and performs numerical calculations "Unanticipated_Consequences_Derivations.nb". The Mathematica notebook uses the data in the file "Prepped_Human_Seroprevalence_Data.csv" to predict the risk of unanaticipated consequences stemming from partial spillover reduction of Lassa virus in West Africa.
